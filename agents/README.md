# Agents

Agent definitions are located in `.claude/agents/`.

This directory previously contained template files, but they have been consolidated
into the Claude Code agent configuration directory to maintain a single source of truth.

## Usage

To modify an agent, edit the corresponding file in `.claude/agents/`.
